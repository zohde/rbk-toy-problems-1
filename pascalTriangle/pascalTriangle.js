/*
Pascal triangle is a triangle made with rows of numbers.
The first row is [1]. 
The second row is [1,1].
In all following rows, each number is the sum of the two directly above it.

For example, the pascal triangle with 4 rows is:

        1
      1   1
    1   2   1
  1   3   3   1

or in array form: [[1],[1,1],[1,2,1],[1,3,3,1]];

The task for this exercise is to write a function that given the number of rows, builds an array of arrays that represents the pascal triangle.

For example:
buildTriangle(3);// should output [[1],[1,1],[1,2,1]];
*/

var buildTriangle = function(numOfRows){
