/*
In this problem set we will review closures. Before you freak out, remember that closure is
just a function that returns another function.

Problem 1:
Write a function that accepts an exponent and returns back a function that accepts
a number and takes it to the power of the exponent.

Example:
var square = pow(2);
var cube = pow(3);

square(3);//should return 9
cube(3);//should return 27
*/

function pow(exponent) {

};

/*
Problem 2:
Write a function pingPongTracker that accepts no arguments and returns an object with the
following methods:
- timeSpentPlaying() should return the total amount of time you have played pingpong.
- playOneGame() should increase the total time you played pingpong by 15 minutes 
  and return a string "Game played"
- myLevel() should return your experience level based on how much time you have spent playing
  pingpong. These are the levels: a) Less than 30 minutes - "I need to improve my game"
                                  b) 30-100 minutes - "You need to improve your game"
                                  c) More than 100 minutes - "Wow, I have wasted a lot of time"

Example:
var myGame = pingPongTracker();
myGame.playOneGame();//should return "Game played";
myGame.playOneGame();//should return "Game played";
myGame.timeSpentPlaying(); //should return 30;
myGame.myLevel(); //should return "You need to improve your game"
*/

var pingPongTracker = function(){

};
